# Smart-Battleships-Game-V2
Game of battleships, which can be played vs computer (which tries to behave like a human player) or vs other player.

Main goal of this project was to learn **object-oriented programming**, **dynamic data structures** and **memory allocation** without using STL.

# Features
 * Changable board size (number of ships changes automatically to cover field of ~30% of the board)
 * Automatic ships allocation
 * Smart computer bot, which guesses in a way that a human person would
 * Saving game contents to a file (under pliki/log)

This project is a continuation of [Smart-Battleships-Game-V1](github.com/GrzegorzGrudzinski/Smart-Battleships-Game.git)
